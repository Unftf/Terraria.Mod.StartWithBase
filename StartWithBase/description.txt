"Start with base" is a small mod which generates a base at the end of world generation. If u are tiered building ur own all the time that mod might work for you. But it won't give you too much.
You still need to place chests and crafting stations. For NPC flats you don't need to care about.
It will check how many NPC your mods contain and resize the base accordingly.

It won't win a design award for good looking :) That's also your part.
The main concept about this base is to reduce ways to NPC's, crafting stations, chests and a high amount of chest you can quick-stack too (after teleport back).
Each of those can be done better but with negative effect for the other. If you think you got a better base structure write me in linked page please. (base made for vanilla, might be a better with mods)

There you can also view how the base will look like at start an how it can look later on.

It would be nice if you can also write me your experience during playthrough with this base mod.

Thanks for testing. gl hf!

Update: 
options for [c/88CC88:alternative tiles and base structure] to compare with. Enter at the end of world name.
$Ba2 - base with 2 NPC flats as core structure
$Ba3 - base with 3 NPC flats as core ($b3b for big version, both look if enough space for all mod items)
$Ba4 - base with 4 .. (useful for many NPC)
$Ba6 - base with 6 NPC flats as core (credits to Sergo for that)
$Fpa, Fdy, Fwo, Fgr, Fbo, Fri ---> changes the furniture material
$Tha, Tob, Tdy, Two, Tss, Tri, Tbo --> changes the tiles used for flats
$Wha, Wdg, Wdy, Wwo, Wss, Wdi, Wri, Wbo --> changes the used wall
$Sy* - random style of used tiles, predefined $Sy0, $Sy1, $Sy2

You can combine those, e.g "MyWorldName$Ba3FdyTssWdi" (without quotes) will select base 3 with dyndasty wood furniture (Fdy), stone slab for Flats (Tss) and dirt as wall behind (Wdi)
