# Terraria.Mod.StartWithBase
<br>
"Start with base" is a small mod which generates a base at the end of world generation considering all NPC's of all active mods. If u are tiered building ur own all the time that mod might work for you. But it won't give you too much.<br>
You still need to place chests and crafting stations. Only for NPC flats you don't need to care about anymore.<br>
It will check how many NPC your active mods contain and resize the base accordingly (only at world gen).<br>
<br>
It won't win a design award for good looking :) That's also your part.<br>
The main concept about this base is to reduce ways to NPC's, crafting stations, chests and a high amount of chest you can quick-stack to (after teleport back).<br>
Each of those can be done better but with negative effect for the other. If you think you got a better base structure write me in linked page please (also base pics there).<br>
<br>
Not all basee have been tested for long play. It would be nice if you can also write me your experience during playthrough with this base mod.<br>
<br>
Thanks for testing. gl hf!<br>

Config your base: left click at the GUI during world generation<br>
or add those commands to world name:<br>
$Ba2 - base with 2 NPC flats as core structure<br>
$Ba3 - base with 3 NPC flats as core ($b3b for big version, both look if enough space for all mod items)<br>
$Ba4 - base with 4 .. (useful for many NPC)<br>
$Ba5 - base with 5 .. below ground<br>
$Ba6 - base with 6 NPC flats as core (credits to Sergo for that)<br>
$Fpa, Fdy, Fwo, Fgr, Fbo, Fri, Fmb ---> changes the furniture material, $D.. only chair and desk <br>
$Tha, Tob, Tdy, Two, Tss, Tri, Tbo, Tgr, Tmb --> changes the tiles used for flats<br>
$Wha, Wdg, Wdy, Wwo, Wss, Wdi, Wri, Wbo, Wgr, Wmb --> changes the used wall<br>
$Lho, Lgl, Ldy, Lwo, Lpa, Lbo, Lgr, Wmb --> changes the used lantern<br>
$Ppa, Pri, Pdy, Pwo, Pbo, Pgr, Pmb, Pic --> changes the used platform<br>
...and many more (no Gui: $noG)<br>
<br>
$Sy* - random style of used tiles, predefined $Sy0, $Sy1, $Sy2<br>
$Cx1 - stores/loads config file which allows you to setup all values as you like<br>
<br>
You can combine those, e.g "MyWorldName$Ba3FdyTssWdi" (without quotes) will select base 3 with dynasty wood furniture (Fdy), stone slab for Flats (Tss) and dirt as wall behind (Wdi)<br>
